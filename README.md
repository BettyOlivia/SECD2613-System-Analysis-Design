# SECD2613-System-Analysis-Design

## Course Overview  <br> 
This course gave me practical experience in system analysis and design using a structured approach. I learned how to gather and analyze system requirements within a real organizational context. The topics were organized step-by-step, starting from planning, moving through analysis and design, and ending with implementation. This helped me understand how to create input, output, and interface designs, and finally build a prototype that demonstrates how a system works.

## Reflection
This course has deepened my understanding of how information systems are developed in a structured and practical manner. Learning the SDLC phases helped me grasp how real-world systems are analyzed, designed, and implemented. I particularly found the case studies and group projects insightful, as they allowed me to apply tools such as data flow diagrams (DFDs) and entity relationship diagrams (ERDs) to real scenarios. Designing a prototype from the ground up, based on user requirements, was both challenging and rewarding. This course has prepared me well for future roles in systems development and project analysis.
